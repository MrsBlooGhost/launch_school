Topic 02: The SQL Language

**What kind of programming language is SQL?**

SQL is a special purpose language, whose purpose is to interact with relational databases.

**What are the three sublanguages of SQL?**

1. Data definition language (DDL), which controls a relation's structure and rules with `CREATE`, `DROP`, and `ALTER`.
2. Data manipulation language (DML), which controls the data stored in a relation using `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
3. Data control language (DCL), which controls accessibility and permissions of certain users, using `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.

**Write the following values as quoted string values that could be used in a SQL query.**
