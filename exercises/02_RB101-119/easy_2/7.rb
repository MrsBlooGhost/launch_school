# ---------------- Problem
# Re-write the problem statement.
# Print all the even numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, on a separate line.

# Input:
# Output: integers

# Rules (implicit and explicit):
# Explicit:
# - Print even numbers between 1 and 99, inclusive.
# - Each number is printed on a separate line.

# ---------------- Examples



# ---------------- Scatchpad
# GREAT IDEA!!


# ---------------- Data Structures
# You may want to create something to bridge the gap between the input and the output.


# ---------------- Algorithm
# Write broad action steps to solve the problem, then create substeps for each broad action step.

# 1. Obtain all the even numbers between 1 and 99, inclusive.
# 2. Print the numbers from step 1 on a separate line.

# ---------------- Code

value = 2
while value <= 99
  puts value
  value += 2
end
