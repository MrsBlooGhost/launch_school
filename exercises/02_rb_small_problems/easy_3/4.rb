# Problem Description:
# Create a method that takes two arguments, multiplies them together, and returns
# the result.

# ---------------- Problem (establish rules, define boundaries) ----------------
# Re-write the problem statement.

# Input: two integers
# Output: an integer that is the product of input integers multiplied

# Rules
# Explicit:
# - the method should return the result of multiplying the two arguments together

# Implicit:
# - Are we assuming that the input is two integers?

# ---------------- Examples (confirm/refute assumptions ----------------
# multiply(5, 3) == 15


# ---------------- Scratchpad ----------------



# ---------------- Data Structures (reason with data logically) ----------------
# Create something to bridge the gap between input and output.



# ---------------- Algorithm (steps from input to output) ----------------
# Write broad action steps to solve the problem. Create substeps for each broad action step.
# 1. Define a method `multiply` that takes two parameters `num1` and `num2`.
# 2. Multiply `num1` by `num2` and return the result.


# ---------------- Code (translate algorithm to programming language) ----------------
def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
