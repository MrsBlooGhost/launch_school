-- Exercise 02: Create a Table

-- Now that we have an animals database, we can lay the groundwork needed to add some data to it.

-- Make a table called birds. It should have the following fields:

-- id (a primary key)
-- name (string with space for up to 25 characters)
-- age (integer)
-- species (a string with room for no more than 15 characters)

CREATE TABLE birds (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(25),
  age integer,
  species varchar(15)
);
