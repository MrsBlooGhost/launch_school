-- Exercise 10: Drop Database

-- Let's finish things up by dropping the database animals. With no tables in it, we don't have much use for it any more. Write a SQL statement or PostgreSQL command to drop the animals database.

-- First, connect to a different database. Then,

DROP DATABASE animals;

-- or

$ dropdb animals
